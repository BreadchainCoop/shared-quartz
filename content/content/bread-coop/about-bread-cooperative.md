Breadchain Cooperative is a **collective federation of decentralized cooperative projects** looking to advance a **progressive vision for blockchain** and its effect on society. We aim to do this by building and utilizing what we call _==solidarity primitives==_ - development tools which help to forge solidarity between individuals and collectives.

The first _==solidarity primitive==_ created by the Breadchain Cooperative is the ==**BREAD**== community token created through the [Bread Crowdstaking Application](https://app.breadchain.xyz/). 

The primary infrastructure being built at Breadchain is to ask ourselves _==**what if progressives had their own**== ==**[[what-is-bread|what-is-bread]]**== ==**and**== ==**[[Yield Governance|Yield Governance]]**====**? Where would we decide to put resources towards to build a post-capitalist political economy?**==_

# ==BREAD as a Community Currency==

## Consistent value

BREAD is linked to xDAI which is a stablecoin with equal value to USD. So $1 = 1 $BREAD.

  

## Built on solidarity

A solidarity primitive is a building block for solidarity through code. Build with $BREAD to have a tech stack with values.

## Fund the future

Earnings from the minting of BREAD go to supporting a co-operative of post-capitalist web3 projects.
