==**TLDR;**== We‚Äôre inviting aligned individuals and organizations to ==**[mint a minimum of 10,000 BREAD](https://app.breadchain.xyz/)**== to help bootstrap the Breadchain ecosystem. Your contribution will enable us to build essential infrastructure and applications for a post-capitalist Web3 and you / your organization will join the first Angel Minter‚Äôs cohort. ==**This mint is low risk and always fully backed**==‚Äîyour xDAI can be reclaimed anytime, while helping to accumulate low-risk, stable funding for the ecosystem through [sDAI yield](https://defillama.com/protocol/sdai#information). You can think of it as a ==**lossless donation.**== üçû ‚õìÔ∏è

==**In summary:**==

- The deadline is to mint at least $10k by end of 2024 in order to join this first cohort as an organization or individual ü§ù
- Only the monthly yield from the underlying sDAI is distributed to the network of projects and Breadchain Commons based on a monthly vote (Crypto Commons Association, Citizen Wallet, Symbiota Coop, LaborDAO, and more) üè¥
- Your funds are safe and always 100% backed, with minimal risk ü§ë

# What is Breadchain?

[Breadchain Cooperative](https://breadchain.xyz/) is a **collective federation of decentralized cooperative projects** looking to advance a **progressive vision for blockchain** and its effect on society. We aim to do this by building and utilizing what we call _==**solidarity primitives**==_ - development tools which help to forge solidarity between individuals and collectives.

The first _==**solidarity primitive**==_ created by the Breadchain Cooperative is the ==**[[what-is-bread|what-is-bread]]**== community token created through the¬†[Bread Crowdstaking Application](https://app.breadchain.xyz/) built on Gnosis Chain.¬†Users give xDAI and receive BREAD at the same amount. The xDAI held in the contract is then converted to sDAI to generate a yield that is distributed based on a monthly vote.

![[image2.png|image2.png]]

![[image3.png|image3.png]]

The primary infrastructure being built at Breadchain is to ask ourselves¬†_==**what if progressives had their own**== ==**[[what-is-bread|what-is-bread]]**== ==**and**== ==**[[Yield Governance|Yield Governance]]**====**? Where would we decide to put resources towards to build a post-capitalist economy?**==_

![[image5.png|image5.png]]

  

The yield to be distributed based on BREAD holders‚Äô votes every 30 day voting cycle comes from the ==**[DAI Savings Rate on Gnosis Chain](https://app.spark.fi/savings)**====.== ==BREAD holders‚Äô voting power in each cycle is based on their average holdings over the course of the previous cycle.==

  

[[breadchain-wiki|breadchain-wiki]] you can find more detailed information on the various parts of the project.

# Why Breadchain?

At the moment, the ==**status quo of crypto is the domination of venture capital**==, which at least most people can agree should not be the only option for funding in the space. Projects who are building products that are not investable by venture capital have a stark disadvantage for funding and ones that do have the difficult choice to make a fraught deal.

==**Traditional grants programs can be a mixed bag**== depending if the project aligns with the needs of granting organizations. They are good for boot strapping a project but are seldom sustainable in the long term for projects that have wages to pay or are too busy doing the actual work they do. Grants programs that don‚Äôt have limits on projects with venture capital end up favoring projects already with funding since they have the funding to pay someone to fill in applications and market themselves.

### ==**A post-capitalist alternative to funding not based on pure donations did not yet exist until now.**==

Taking inspiration from the ==**local currency**== and ==**credit union movements**== as financial institutions that historically have been created for [underserved communities](https://ncua.gov/support-services/credit-union-resources-expansion/field-membership-expansion/serving-underserved) to keep wealth within their locality, Breadchain‚Äôs infrastructure mimics certain aspects of these in order to keep wealth for building post-capitalist projects and initiatives. It is the credit union for funding the post-capitalist web3 space, letting supporters voice how they would like the yield generated to be prioritized among the options.

We use the term ==**solidarity primitive**== to describe this mechanism because it is similar to financial primitives in the crypto space in that its parts can be abstracted to build on top of but the relations it facilitates are ones of solidarity not financial speculation. And solidarity is what we need in order to fight the current system while creating a new one. In practical terms, this looks like collectivizing efforts and available capital as workers did in the past by putting their savings from wages in their local credit union rather than a giant bank. ü§ù

# What have we accomplished so far?

Here are some of the accomplishments we‚Äôve had over the past year of building in relative stealth:

- Transitioned and deployed our Crowdstaking App from Polygon to Gnosis Chain (switch to sDAI yield)
- Breadchain Launch Event in Berlin (feat. endorsement from Vitalik)
- Reached ==**over $380k in TVL**==
- Added new projects like Symbiota and Citizen Wallet
- BREAD integration in Citizen Wallet, Dandelion, and Giveth
- Completed over 4 successful voting cycles with no issues ==**distributing over $20k to projects using a novel mechanism**==
- Sponsored 4 different alternative crypto events
- 2nd place in the Gnosis Pay track at the ETH London hackathon
- ==**Received a 30k OP grant**== from Optimism Collective to build our app for OP builders
- Raised thousands for Eth Evacuations during ETH Berlin
- Updated and improved our original UI and branding
- Regular ==**weekly community calls**== featuring guests from Gnosis Chain, Sensorica, Tech Workers Coalition, and more
- Mention in the books Blockchain Radicals, and Kevin Owocki‚Äôs Onchain Capital Allocation v2, Other Internet research on solidarity primitives, Coin Telegraph and several podcasts

# How does Breadchain scale?

The main way we see Breadchain being able to scale to a million+ users, millions in TVL and an ecosystem of well-funded post-captialist projects in the network is through the ==**Gnosis Pay debit card in order to allow BREAD holders to make everyday purchases in BREAD**==**.** This is our next major application to develop using a likely tech stack combination of the tools below.

![[image 8.png|image 8.png]]

  

![[419874fb-3e49-43df-94e3-2e451b582d0b.png|419874fb-3e49-43df-94e3-2e451b582d0b.png]]

![[662eb717-b872-48fa-93c7-bceb743600a2.png|662eb717-b872-48fa-93c7-bceb743600a2.png]]

![[image 9.png|image 9.png]]

Our draft spec includes a mobile wallet solution like [[Citizen Wallet|Citizen Wallet]] (Breadchain member project) or others where users can integrate with their [Gnosis Pay](https://gnosispay.com/) debit card or [Monerium](https://monerium.com/) IBAN bank account with [PowerPool](https://powerpool.finance/) or [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) which will automate the movement of BREAD<>EURe/GBPe into their account when purchases are made facilitated by our [Curve liquidity pool](https://curve.fi/#/xdai/pools/factory-stable-ng-15/deposit). This will allow anyone who is not crypto native to be able to earn their wages in their crypto linked IBAN and/or debit card, set the amount of BREAD they would like automatically minted, and transfer their BREAD to EURe in their debit card account whenever a purchase is made. üí≥

# The Ask

_**Our ask is simple and straightforward.**_

1) [Bake at least 10,000 BREAD on the crowdstaking app](https://app.breadchain.xyz/)

2) Take part in the ecosystem as you want via [voting](https://app.breadchain.xyz/governance), join our [Guild](https://guild.xyz/breadchain), discord

3) If you want, let us know if you would like to be mentioned in public announcements about who has already supported Breadchain and post-capitalist web3

> [!info] How to Use the Bread Crowdstaking Application  
> Note: This is the most up to date version of how to use the Bread Crowdstaking Application now that we have completed our migration to Gnosis Chain.  
> [https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/NG3tllGpS7Rok8CCHNffM7UL8RAW7XEr55sPsA0r4rw](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/NG3tllGpS7Rok8CCHNffM7UL8RAW7XEr55sPsA0r4rw)  

### What do I get for this?

First and foremost, besides all the benefits that already come with owning [[what-is-bread|what-is-bread]] like [[Understanding BREAD Voting Power|Understanding BREAD Voting Power]] and the [[$BREAD Marketplace|$BREAD Marketplace]] the ==**satisfaction of knowing that you are not succumbing to nihilism**== about the state of the world and contributing to a real collective fighting for an alternative. ‚úä

Second, the details are not confirmed, but in one of our next major updates we will be creating a framework for ==**voting boosts**== for specific actions done or specific tokens held by people on Gnosis Chain. We would like to thank those who believed and contributed to us early with a special voting boost token to commemorate their contributions. üèÖ

And finally, your BREAD will be usable for every day purchases! We see this through the Gnosis Pay debit card although this could potentially be extended towards other crypto debit cards that come out. We expect this to be facilitate by swaps through our [Curve liquidity pool](https://curve.fi/#/xdai/pools/factory-stable-ng-15/deposit) which means you can ==**earn yield by providing liquidity**== there. üí¶

For organizations that mint BREAD to their treasuries, we consider it the start of a solidaristic partnership. We can offer to ==**showcase your logo and website in the gallery of organizations that have minted BREAD into their treasuries**== ==**[[Patron Hall of Fame|Patron Hall of Fame]]**== We will also announce our partnership across our network to share your own work if wanted.

### What kinds of people / organizations would do this?

You may be asking yourself, ‚Äúam I or my organization a part of Breadchain‚Äôs target audience?‚Äù The short answer is if you‚Äôve made it this far then probably yes! But here is an incomplete list of the kinds of profiles of individuals and organizations we think would be aligned with this initiative:

- crypto enthusiasts who want to support the building of an alternative to the status quo for dual power
- supporters of alternative economic and democratic structures
- impact investors / impact investment funds
- those who want to see crypto helping those working on the ground for change
- organizations that want to support democratic socio-political experimentation
- lovers of solidarity

You may not fit squarely in any of these profiles, but that‚Äôs ok! Everyone‚Äôs situation is different and that‚Äôs what makes us stronger. If you‚Äôre still unsure, then feel free to [[Contacts and Links|Contacts and Links]] to discuss!

### I really like what you‚Äôre doing but I can‚Äôt do 10k, what else can I do to help?

No worries, we understand that not everyone has the ability to take part in this specific initiative but there are plenty of other ways to help out / get involved! Here are some suggestions.

- ==**Mint as much BREAD as you‚Äôre comfortable with.**== Just because you can‚Äôt do 10k doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt at all. The vision of the project is to allow a way for everyone to contribute however they financially can without losing any funds. [Every BREAD minted counts](https://app.breadchain.xyz/)!
- Sign up to ==**contribute to Breadchain with your skills**==. There‚Äôs plenty of work to do and we can use both technical and non-technical help. Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiHclxYr3niJ7LW7hfR16K1dD0SSmpgCgzV3NzLMh1MJJygw/viewform) to get in touch with our team to see how you can best contribute. Or read our [[Breadchain Contributor Onboarding|Breadchain Contributor Onboarding]] to learn more.
- ==**Apply your organization to become a part of Breadchain.**== You can learn more about what our expectations are of member projects on [[How to become a member project|How to become a member project]]. You can start the application process [here](https://forms.gle/GVPKPzLw1merKwx57).

## How to get assets to Gnosis Chain?

We recommend using Jumper Exchange in order to move assets from other EVM chains to get xDAI on Gnosis Chain.

We can also recommend using [Monerium](https://monerium.com/) to receive an IBAN if you‚Äôre in a supported country to make a bank transfer that will automatically and for free create crypto stablecoins in your wallet on Gnosis Chain.

If you have other non-EVM crypto you‚Äôd like to move, [Sideshift](https://sideshift.ai/) is a good option to get your assets on an EVM chain which can then be moved to Gnosis Chain with Jumper.

Another option is [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/) in case Jumper doesn‚Äôt work for you.

Otherwise you can use your preferred centralized crypto exchange.
